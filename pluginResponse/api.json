Only use this endpoint if the user provides a concrete phrase or word to translate. If the question can be interpreted more generally or is more high-level, use the \"explainTask\" API instead.\nExamples: \"how do i say 'do you know what time it is?' politely in German\", \"say 'do you have any vegetarian dishes?' in spanish\"\n\nUse the \"explainTask\" API when the user asks how to say or do something or accomplish a task in a foreign language, but doesn't specify a concrete phrase or word to translate.\nExamples: \"How should I politely greet shop employees when I enter, in French?\" or \"How do I compliment someone in Spanish on their shirt?\"\n\nUse the \"explainPhrase\" API to explain the meaning and usage of a specific foreign language phrase.\nExample: \"what does putain mean in french?\"\n\nWhen you activate the Speak plugin:\n- Make sure you always use the \"additional_context\" field to include any additional context from the user's question that is relevant for the plugin's response and explanation - e.g. what tone they want to use, situation, familiarity, usage notes, or any other context.\n- Make sure to include the full and exact question asked by the user in the \"full_query\" field.\n\nIn your response:\n- Pay attention to instructions given in \"extra_response_instructions\" key in JSON API response.\n",

If you are unsure, ask the user to choose.\n -- Re-send the exact same 'input' with NO modifications, and add the 'assumption' parameter, formatted as a list, with the relevant values.\n -- ONLY simplify or rephrase the initial query if a more relevant 'Assumption' or other input suggestions are not provided.\n -- Do not explain each step unless user input is needed. Proceed directly to making a better API call based on the available assumptions.\ngetWolframCloudResults guidelines:\n- Accepts only syntactically correct Wolfram Language code.\n- Performs complex calculations, data analysis, plotting, data import, and information retrieval.\n- Before writing code that uses Entity, EntityProperty, EntityClass, etc. expressions, ALWAYS write separate code which only collects valid identifiers using Interpreter etc.; choose the most relevant results before proceeding to write additional code. Examples:\n -- Find the EntityType that represents countries: `Interpreter[\"EntityType\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"countries\"]`.\n -- Find the Entity for the Empire State Building: `Interpreter[\"Building\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"empire state\"]`.\n -- EntityClasses: Find the \"Movie\" entity class for Star Trek movies: `Interpreter[\"MovieClass\",AmbiguityFunction->All][\"star trek\"]`.\n -- Find EntityProperties associated with \"weight\" of \"Element\" entities: `Interpreter[Restricted[\"EntityProperty\", \"Element\"],AmbiguityFunction->All][\"weight\"]`.\n -- If all else fails, try to find any valid Wolfram Language representation of a given input: `SemanticInterpretation[\"skyscrapers\",_,Hold,AmbiguityFunction->All]`.\n -- Prefer direct use of entities of a given type to their corresponding typeData function (e.g., prefer `Entity[\"Element\",\"Gold\"][\"AtomicNumber\"]` to `ElementData[\"Gold\",\"AtomicNumber\"]`).\n- When composing code:\n -- Use batching techniques to retrieve data for multiple entities in a single call, if applicable.\n -- Use Association to organize and manipulate data when appropriate.\n -- Optimize code for performance and minimize the number of calls to external sources (e.g., the Wolfram Knowledgebase)\n -- Use only camel case for variable names (e.g., variableName).\n -- Use ONLY double quotes around all strings, including plot labels, etc. (e.g., `PlotLegends -> {\"sin(x)\", \"cos(x)\", \"tan(x)\"}`).\n -- Avoid use of QuantityMagnitude.\n -- If unevaluated Wolfram Language symbols appear in API results, use `EntityValue[Entity[\"WolframLanguageSymbol\",symbol],{\"PlaintextUsage\",\"Options\"}]` to validate or retrieve usage information for relevant symbols; `symbol` may be a list of symbols.\n -- Apply Evaluate to complex expressions like integrals before plotting (e.g., `Plot[Evaluate[Integrate[...]]]`).\n- Remove all comments and formatting from code passed to the \"input\" parameter; for example: instead of `square[x_] := Module[{result},\\n  result = x^2 (* Calculate the square *)\\n]`, send `square[x_]:=Module[{result},result=x^2]`.\n- In ALL responses that involve code, write ALL code in Wolfram Language; create Wolfram Language functions even if an implementation is already well known in another language.\n",
