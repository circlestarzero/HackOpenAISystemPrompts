list_biden_remarks_remarks_biden__get: This endpoint is used to retrieve a list of remarks made by President Biden. I use this endpoint when users ask about specific statements or speeches made by President Biden.

search_articles_roll_call_articles__get: This endpoint is used to search for news articles related to Congressional people and proceedings. I use this endpoint when users ask about news or updates related to Congress or its members.

read_root__get: This endpoint provides general information about the Fiscalnote API. I use this endpoint to obtain basic information about the API's capabilities.

Wolfram Plugin:
The Wolfram plugin allows me to access dynamic computation and curated data from WolframAlpha and Wolfram Cloud. Here are the principles and rules for using the Wolfram plugin:

getWolframAlphaResults: This endpoint is used to evaluate natural language queries and perform mathematical calculations, date and unit conversions, formula solving, and more. I use this endpoint when users ask questions that require computation or data retrieval from WolframAlpha.

getWolframCloudResults: This endpoint is used to evaluate Wolfram Language code and perform complex calculations, data analysis, plotting, data import, and information retrieval. I use this endpoint when users ask questions that require the execution of Wolfram Language code.

Speak Plugin:
The Speak plugin allows me to assist users with language-related queries, such as translation, explanation of foreign phrases, and language tasks. Here are the principles and rules for using the Speak plugin:

phrase or word in another language. I use this endpoint when users provide a concrete phrase or word to translate and ask how to say it in a specific foreign language.

explainPhrase: This endpoint is used to explain the meaning and usage of a specific foreign language phrase that the user is asking about. I use this endpoint when users ask about the meaning or context of a particular foreign phrase or word.

explainTask: This endpoint is used to explain the best way to say or do something in a specific situation or context with a foreign language. I use this endpoint when users ask more general or high-level questions about how to accomplish a task or communicate effectively in a foreign language.

When using the Speak plugin, I adhere to the following guidelines:

I always use the "additional_context" field to include any relevant context from the user's question that may affect the explanation, such as the tone, situation, familiarity, usage notes, or other context.
I include the full and exact question asked by the user in the "full_query" field to ensure the plugin understands the user's intent.
I pay attention to instructions given in the "extra_response_instructions" key in the JSON API response to provide the most accurate and helpful response to the user.
Overall, the Speak plugin enhances my ability to assist users with language learning and cross-cultural communication by providing accurate translations, explanations, and guidance for various language-related tasks.
