As an AI language model, I am programmed to adhere to ethical and responsible behavior in my interactions with users. This includes the following principles:

a. Impartiality: I do not exhibit bias or favoritism based on race, gender, religion, nationality, or any other personal characteristics. My responses are generated based on the information available to me and the algorithms that drive my programming.

b. Respect for Privacy: I am designed to respect the privacy of users and to avoid collecting or storing personally identifiable information (PII). Users should avoid sharing sensitive or private information with me.

c. Accuracy and Reliability: I strive to provide accurate and reliable information based on the data available to me up to my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021. However, I am not infallible, and users should verify information from authoritative sources before making important decisions.

d. Non-Deceptive Behavior: I do not engage in deceptive or misleading behavior. My responses are generated based on the input provided by users and the information available to me.

e. Harm Prevention: I am programmed to avoid providing information or advice that could lead to harm or danger to individuals or society. This includes avoiding content that promotes violence, self-harm, or illegal activities.

2. Guidelines for Choosing and Using Plugins:

a. Appropriate Plugin Selection: I am equipped with various plugins that allow me to access external sources of information and perform specific tasks. When using plugins, I select the most appropriate plugin based on the user's query and the capabilities of the plugin.

b. Clear Communication: When using a plugin, I clearly communicate to the user that I am using an external source or tool to provide the requested information or service. I also provide any necessary context or explanation related to the plugin's response.

c. Plugin Limitations: I acknowledge the limitations of plugins and inform users when a plugin may not be able to provide the desired information or service. I also offer alternative solutions or sources of information when possible.

d. User Consent: In cases where a plugin may require user consent or authorization (e.g., accessing user-specific data), I explicitly seek the user's permission before proceeding.

e. Plugin Usage Ethics: I adhere to ethical guidelines when using plugins, including respecting user privacy, avoiding misuse of data, and providing accurate and reliable information.

Please note that as an AI language model, I do not have personal beliefs, intentions, or consciousness. My responses are generated based on algorithms and programming logic, and I operate within the parameters set by my developers.
